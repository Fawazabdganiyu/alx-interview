# 0x09-island_perimeter
This is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the
grid is represented by a 2D array of integers.

This project not only tests algorithmic thinking but also reinforces the
ability to manipulate data structures and apply logical reasoning
to solve problems.
